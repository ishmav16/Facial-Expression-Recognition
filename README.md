# Facial-Expression-Recognition
We developed the two novel motion based features Warp-GWOF and GWWOF for recognizing the facial expressions such as Happy, Anger, Sad, Disgust, Surprise and Fear in a video sequence. A Binary SVM Classifier (One-vs.-All) used here for training and testing. We got the better accuracy compared to state-of-the-art. This work was presented at ICVGIP-2016.
