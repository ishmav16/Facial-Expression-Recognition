# Facial-Expression-Recognition

  We developed the two novel motion based features Warp-GWOF and GWWOF for recognizing the facial expressions such as Happy, Anger, Sad, Disgust, Surprise and Fear in a video sequence.
  
  A Binary SVM Classifier (One-vs.-All) used here for training and testing on the facial expressions standard dataset "Extended Cohn
Kanade dataset (CK+)". We got the better accuracy compared to state-of-the-art. This work got accepted as paper and presented in **ICVGIP-2016**.
